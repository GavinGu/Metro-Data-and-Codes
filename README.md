# Metro-Data-and-Codes
This project is for our work "Measuring Fine-grained Metro Interchange Time via Smartphones". 
The folder of "dataset" contains sampled dataset of our job. The "User_info.mat" is the data of "In Metro" and "Interchange" in the first layer. The "Interchange_data.mat" is the data of 10 cases of interchange in the second layer.
The folder of "codes" contains the core algorithms of our job. You can run "Metro_interchange_infer.m" to see the inferred results of "In Metro" and "Interchange", and can also run "Interchange_case_infer.m" to see the predicted results of 10 cases.

Note: The dataset of this version is sampled. We are working towards providing access to all the dataset by ensuring privacy of the volunteers and documenting the dataset. We are also working to optimize the user interface of our system and plan to open source all the code shortly.
